                <h2>Background</h2>
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Hello! My name is Braydon. I'm 27, a proud Indigenous Australian from Nipaluna (Hobart), Lutruwita
                    (Tasmania). I'm super passionate about IT and computers—with a keen interest in networking,
                    cybersecurity, web development, and system administration, just to name a few.</p>

                <h3>Education and Experience</h3>
                <p>Earning my Certificate III in Information Technology provided me with a solid foundation, and my
                    partial completion of the Certificate IV in Information Technology (Networking) deepened my
                    understanding of the field—eventually inspiring my current studies in Web Development. During my
                    Certificate III, I benefited greatly from a work placement at <a href="https://dxc.com/au/en"
                        target="_blank">DXC Technology</a> in Hobart, where the team provided an exceptional learning
                    environment.</p><br>
                <p>I later returned to TAFE, uncertain about future job prospects, only to secure a position at <a
                        href="https://www.techquity.com.au" target="_blank">Techquity</a> in North Hobart. I ultimately
                    decided to withdraw from the Certificate IV to focus on gaining hands-on, practical experience with
                    Techquity. Although I was eager to build a long-term career there, the role did not develop as I had
                    hoped, and I felt that my potential was not fully recognized. Nonetheless, the overall experience
                    provided invaluable real-world insights into the IT industry.</p>

                <h3>Interests and Ambitions</h3>
                <p>I have a diverse range of interests that blend creativity with technical passion. As an avid rap
                    enthusiast and emerging music producer, I've collaborated on projects with a few artists, immersing
                    myself in the art of sound. My background in VFX, film, and video editing has deepened my
                    appreciation for visual storytelling, while my love for gaming—especially the Dark Souls series by
                    Hidetaka Miyazaki, along with titles like Bloodborne, Elden Ring, and Sekiro—has captivated me with
                    their intricate art and rich narratives.</p><br>
                <p>After completing TAFE, I discovered my passion for the IT
                    industry, and I'm now eager to embrace a role that challenges me and fosters continuous
                    growth—either by entering the workforce or continuing my studies toward a diploma.</p><br>
                <p>I have high ambitions and hope to build a career in any facet of IT, whether as a Junior IT Support
                    Officer, Web Developer, or Network Engineer—the list goes on. I am committed to furthering my
                    professional development by earning various Microsoft Certifications, including the Azure
                    Fundamentals Certification, which not only add credibility but also represent a polished, official
                    step toward establishing a strong reputation in the field.</p>
