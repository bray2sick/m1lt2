        <h2>Background</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Hello! My name is Braydon. I'm 27, a proud Indigenous Australian from Nipaluna (Hobart), Lutruwita
          (Tasmania). I'm super passionate about IT and computers—with a keen interest in networking,
          cybersecurity, web development, and system administration, just to name a few.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="timeline-item">
        <h3>Education and Experience</h3>
        <p>Earning my Certificate III in Information Technology provided me with a solid foundation, and my
          partial completion of the Certificate IV in Information Technology (Networking) deepened my
          understanding of the field—eventually inspiring my current studies in Web Development. During my
          Certificate III, I benefited greatly from a work placement at <a href="https://dxc.com/au/en"
            target="_blank">DXC Technology</a> in Hobart, where the team provided an exceptional learning
          environment.</p><br>
        <p>I later returned to TAFE, uncertain about future job prospects, only to secure a position at <a
            href="https://www.techquity.com.au" target="_blank">Techquity</a> in North Hobart. I ultimately
          decided to withdraw from the Certificate IV to focus on gaining hands-on, practical experience with
          Techquity. Although I was eager to build a long-term career there, the role did not develop as I had
          hoped, and I felt that my potential was not fully recognized. Nonetheless, the overall experience
          provided invaluable real-world insights into the IT industry.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="timeline-item">
        <h3>Interests and Ambitions</h3>
        <p>I have a diverse range of interests that blend creativity with technical passion. As an avid rap
          enthusiast and music producer, I've collaborated on projects with a few artists, immersing
          myself in the art of sound. My background in VFX, film, and video editing has deepened my
          appreciation for visual storytelling, while my love for gaming—especially the Dark Souls series by
          Hidetaka Miyazaki, along with titles like Bloodborne, Elden Ring, and Sekiro—has captivated me with
          their intricate art and rich narratives.</p><br>
        <p>After completing TAFE, I discovered my passion for the IT
          industry, and I'm now eager to embrace a role that challenges me and fosters continuous
          growth—either by entering the workforce or continuing my studies toward a diploma.</p><br>
        <p>I have high ambitions and hope to build a career in any facet of IT, whether as a Junior IT Support
          Officer, Web Developer, or Network Engineer—the list goes on. I am committed to furthering my
          professional development by earning various Microsoft Certifications, including the Azure
          Fundamentals Certification, which not only add credibility but also represent a polished, official
          step toward establishing a strong reputation in the field.</p>

      <section class="timeline-item">
        <h3>Inspirations</h3>
        <p>I get inspired by everyday moments and experiences. A lot of my former teachers at TasTAFE
          encouraged me to believe in what I could achieve, and their support still drives me today. When it
          comes to web development, I love exploring beautifully designed websites. Here are a few that caught
          my eye recently: <a href="https://ollivere.co/" target="_blank">Ollivere</a>, <a href="https://yzy-sply.com/"
            target="_blank">YZY</a>, <a href="https://5scontent.com/homepage/" target="_blank">5S</a>, <a
            href="https://www.mcmaster.com/" target="_blank">McMaster-Carr</a>,
          <a href="https://tasmaniafc.com/" target="_blank">Tasmanian
            Football Club: Tasmania Devils</a>, <a href="https://www.blundstone.com.au/" target="_blank">Blundstone</a>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>I really admire the Ollivere website because of its smooth animations and overall flow. The Tasmania
          Football Club website, designed by <a href="https://neonjungle.studio/" target="_blank">Neon
            Jungle Studio</a>, also stands out with its attention to detail—I particularly like how the
          flash popup on the initial page load adds a unique touch.</p>

        <h3>Next Steps</h3>
        <p>My next steps and goals are to continue working on Web Development and achieve my Certificate IV in
          Information Technology (Web Development). I hope to learn a lot from this course and discover things I
          didn't know. This website showcases my current skills, though it’s very basic—I'm practicing simple HTML
          and CSS without relying heavily on AI. The "Intro to HTML" learning task has already helped me a lot.</p><br>
        <p>I plan to work on creating websites from <a href="https://www.frontendpractice.com/" target="_blank">Frontend
            Practice</a>, which gives developers real-world scenarios and real websites that they can recreate and
          reverse engineer. It's been a helpful tool for me, and I've learned a lot of different CSS features through
          creating their websites.</p>
